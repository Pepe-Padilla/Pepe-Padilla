## Hi there! I'm José Padilla (but you can call me Pepe) 👋

- 🎓 **Computer Science Engineer**  
  - Master's degree in System Process Management  
  - Master's degree in Full-Stack Web/Mobile Development  
  - [Ongoing] Master Bootcamp in Artificial Intelligence Full Stack  

- 👨‍💻 **Software Engineer & Technical Lead** with over 16 years of experience in development, technical leadership, and support.  

- 🌱 Currently enrolled in the **Full-Stack Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp** at [KeepCoding](https://www.linkedin.com/school/keepcoding/posts/?feedView=all) [@KeepCoding](https://github.com/KeepCoding).  

- 🤘 **Passionate about learning.** I constantly explore new programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. Beyond software engineering, I'm also eager to learn about science, history, critical thinking, and economics.  

- 💬 **Feel free to ask me anything!** I'm always happy to share knowledge and discuss interesting topics.  

- 🎮 **A little story about me:** Recently, I was practicing new frameworks and started a typical project (sales, customers, etc.), but my daughter asked me to play with her. Instead of stopping, I decided to turn it into a fun project we could do together! She created all the artwork, and we built this **mini JavaScript game**—which we still improve from time to time. Just a small example of how to combine work and family fun! 🕹️✨
